## Description

This project is a modified e-commerce website based on a course called Complete React Developer by Andrei Neagoie and Yihua Zhang.

The website's aesthetics was redesigned by me with CSS and JavaScript as I worked on this project in order to brush up on my coding skills.

This project contains features such as sign in/out, sign up, routing, CRUD operations, cart functionality, checkout with stripe and more.

The aesthetic improvements include a website redesign, fixed menu, animations and responsive design.
